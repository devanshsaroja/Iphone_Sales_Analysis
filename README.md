# Apple iPhone Analysis

This project provides an analysis of various iPhone models based on ratings, reviews, sales prices, and discounts. Using **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Plotly Express** for visualization, we examine the relationships between these factors and provide insights into how different iPhone models perform in terms of customer engagement and pricing.

## Project Structure

- **`apple_products.csv`**: The dataset containing information about various iPhone models, their ratings, reviews, sale prices, and discount percentages.
- **`apple_iphone_analysis.py`**: The Python script that loads the dataset, performs analysis, and generates visualizations.

## Key Insights

1. **Top 10 Highest Rated iPhones**: 
    - We identified the top 10 iPhone models based on their star ratings.
    - Visualized the number of ratings and reviews for these models.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
    - Analyzed the relationship between the **Number of Ratings** and **Sale Price** using a scatter plot.
    - Found a **weak negative correlation** between the number of ratings and the sale price, indicating that iPhones with more ratings tend to have slightly lower prices.
    - Analyzed the relationship between the **Number of Ratings** and **Discount Percentage**, finding a **positive correlation**. iPhones with higher discounts generally tend to receive more ratings.

## Visualizations

### 1. Number of Ratings for Highest Rated iPhones

- Shows the number of ratings for the top 10 highest-rated iPhones.

### 2. Number of Reviews for Highest Rated iPhones

- Displays the number of reviews for the top 10 highest-rated iPhones.

### 3. Relationship between Sales Price and Number of Ratings

- A scatter plot illustrating the weak negative correlation between the number of ratings and the sales price.

### 4. Relationship between Discount Percentage and Number of Ratings

- A scatter plot showing the positive correlation between discount percentages and the number of ratings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Plotly Express
- Statsmodels (optional, for OLS trendline)
